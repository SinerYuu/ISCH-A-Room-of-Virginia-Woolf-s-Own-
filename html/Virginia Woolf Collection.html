          Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          For Lucy had her work cut out for her. The<br>
          doors would be taken off their hinges; Rumpel-<br>
          mayer’s men were coming. And then, thought<br>
          Clarissa Dalloway, what a morning—fresh as if<br>
          issued to children on a beach.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          What a lark! What a plunge! For so it had<br>
          always seemed to her, when, with a little squeak<br>
          of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had<br>
          burst open the French windows and plunged at<br>
          Bourton into the open air. How fresh, how calm,<br>
          stiller than this of course, the air was in the early<br>
          morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a<br>
          wave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen<br>
          as she then was) solemn, feeling as she did, stand-<br>
          ing there at the open window, that something awful<br>
          was about to happen; looking at the flowers, at the<br>
          trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks<br>
          rising, falling; standing and looking until Peter
          </p><hr><p><em>Page 3</em></p>
          Walsh said, “Musing among the vegetables?” — was<br>
          that it? — “I prefer men to cauliflowers” — was that<br>
          it? He must have said it at breakfast one morning<br>
          when she had gone out on to the terrace — Peter<br>
          Walsh. He would be back from India one of these<br>
          days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters<br>
          were awfully dull; it was his sayings one remem-<br>
          bered; his eyes, his pocket‑knife, his smile, his<br>
          grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly<br>
          vanished — how strange it was! — a few sayings like<br>
          this about cabbages.
        <p></p>
        <p>
          She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for<br>
          Durntall’s van to pass. A charming woman, Scrope<br>
          Purvis thought her (knowing her as one does know<br>
          people who live next door to one in Westminster);<br>
          a touch of the bird about her, of the jay, blue‑green,<br>
          light, vivacious, though she was over fifty, and<br>
          grown very white since her illness. There she<br>
          perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very<br>
          upright.
        </p>
        <p>
          For having lived in Westminster — how many<br>
          years now? over twenty, — one feels even in the<br>
          midst of the traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa<br>
          was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an<br>
          indescribable pause; a suspense (but that might<br>
          be her heart, affected, they said, by influenza) be-<br>

<h3>Preface</h3>
        Preface
        <p>
          MANY friends have helped me in writing this book.<br> 
          Some are dead and so illustrious that I scarcely<br> 
          dare name them, yet no one can read or write without being<br> 
          perpetually in the debt of Defoe, Sir Thomas Browne,<br> 
          Sterne, Sir Walter Scott, Lord Macaulay, Emily Bronté,<br> 
          De Quincey, and Walter Pater,—to name the first that come<br> 
          to mind. Others are alive, and though perhaps as illustrious<br> 
          in their own way, are less formidable for that very reason.<br> 
          I am specially indebted to Mr. C. P. Sanger, without whose<br> 
          knowledge of the law of real property this book could never<br> 
          have been written. Mr. Sydney-Turner’s wide and peculiar<br> 
          erudition has saved me, I hope, some lamentable blunders.<br>
          I have had the advantage—how great I alone can estimate<br>
          —of Mr. Arthur Waley’s knowledge of Chinese. Madame<br>
          Lopokova (Mrs. F. M. Keynes) has been at hand to correct<br>
          my Russian. To the unrivalled sympathy and imagination<br>
          of Mr. Roger Fry I owe whatever understanding of the art<br>
          of painting I may possess. I have, I hope, profited in an-<br>
          other department by the singularly penetrating, if severe,<br>
          criticism of my nephew Mr. Fulian Bell. Miss M. K.<br> 
          Snowdon’ s indefatigable researches in the archives of Har-<br> 
          rogate and Cheltenham were none the less arduous for being<br> 
          vain. Other friends have helped me in ways too various to <br>

          Davidson; Mrs. Cartwright; Miss fanet Case; Lord Ber-<br>

          Stephen; Mr. F. L. Lucas; Mr. and Mrs. Desmond Mac-<br>

          my sister, Vanessa Bell—but the list threatens to grow too<br> 
          long and is already far too distinguished. For while it rouses<br> 
          in me memories of the pleasantest kind it will inevitably<br> 
          wake expectations in the reader which the book itself can<br> 
          only disappoint. Therefore I will conclude by thanking the<br> 
          officials of the British Museum and Record Office for their<br> 
          wonted courtesy; my niece Miss Angelica Bell, for a service<br>

<h3>Historical Context of the Virginia Woolf Portrait</h3>
        Historical Context of the Virginia Woolf Portrait
        <p>This portrait of Virginia Woolf was taken in 1902 by George Charles Beresford, a prominent photographer known for his portraits of literary figures. The photograph captures Woolf at age 20, well before she would publish her first novel, The Voyage Out (1915).</p>

        <p>At the time this photograph was taken, Woolf was living at 22 Hyde Park Gate with her father, Leslie Stephen, following the death of her mother in 1895. This period preceded the formation of the influential Bloomsbury Group, which would later establish Woolf as a central figure in modernist literature.</p>

        <p>The portrait shows the young writer before her struggles with mental illness intensified, though she had already experienced periods of nervous breakdown following family bereavements. The contemplative expression and direct gaze present a woman of serious intellectual purpose, characteristics that would define her literary career.</p>

        <p>This image is particularly significant as it documents Virginia Woolf before she adopted her married name and before her literary fame. It captures a transitional moment in her life, between her sheltered Victorian upbringing and her emergence as a pioneering modernist author.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
        CHAPTER I
        <p>
            But, you may say, we asked you to speak about<br>
            women and fiction—what has that got to do with<br>
            a room of one’s own? I will try to explain. When you<br>
            asked me to speak about women and fiction I sat<br>
            down on the banks of a river and began to Wonder<br>
            what the words meant. They might mean simply a<br>
            few remarks about Fanny Burney; a few more about<br>
            Jane Austen; a tribute to the Brontes and a sketch<br>
            of Haworth Parsonage under snow; some witticisms<br>
            if possible about Miss Mitford; a respectful allusion<br>
            to George Eliot; a reference to Mrs. Gaskell and<br>
            one would have done. But at second sight the words<br>
            seemed not so simple. The title women and fiction<br>
            might mean, and you may have meant it to mean,<br>
            women and what they are like; or it might mean<br>
            women and the fiction that they write; or it might<br>
        </p>
        
            This essay is based upon two papers read to the Arts<br>
            Society at Newnham and the Odtaa at Girton in October<br>
            1928. The papers were too long to be read in full, and<br>
            have since been altered and expanded.<br>

        <p>
            mean women and the fiction that is written about<br> 
            them; or it might mean that somehow all three are<br>
            inextricably mixed together and you want me to<br> 
            consider them in that light. But when I began to<br> 
            consider the subject in this last way, which seemed the<br> 
            most interesting, I soon saw that it had one fatal<br> 
            drawback. I should never be able to come to a<br> 
            conclusion. I should never be able to fulfil what is,<br> 
            I understand, the first duty of a lecturer—to hand<br> 
            you after an hour’s discourse a nugget of pure<br>
            truth to wrap up between the pages of your note¬<br>
            books and keep on the mantelpiece for ever. All I<br>
            could do was to offer you an opinion upon one<br>
            minor point—a woman must have money and a<br>
            room of her own if she is to write fiction; and that,<br>
            as you will see, leaves the great problem of the true<br>
            nature of woman and the true nature of fiction<br>
            unsolved. I have shirked the duty of coming to a<br>
            conclusion upon these two questions—women and<br>
            fiction remain, so far as I am concerned, unsolved<br>
            problems. But in order to make some amends I<br>
            am going to do what I can to show you how I<br>
            arrived at this opinion about the room and the<br> 
            money. I am going to develop in your presence as<br> 
            fully and freely as I can the train of thought which<br> 
            led me to think this. Perhaps if I lay bare the ideas,<br>

            "Yes, of course, if it's fine to-morrow," said Mrs.<br>
            Ramsay. "But you'll have to be up with the<br>
            lark," she added.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            To her son these words conveyed an extra-<br>
            ordinary joy, as if it were settled the expedition<br>
            were bound to take place, and the wonder to<br>
            which he had looked forward, for years and years<br>
            it seemed, was, after a night's darkness and a day's<br>
            sail, within touch. Since he belonged, even at<br>
            the age of six, to that great clan which cannot<br>
            keep this feeling separate from that, but must let<br>
            future prospects, with their joys and sorrows,<br>
            cloud what is actually at hand, since to such people<br>
            even in earliest childhood any turn in the wheel<br>
            of sensation has the power to crystallise and<br>
            transfix the moment upon which its gloom or<br>
            radiance rests, James Ramsay, sitting on the floor<br>
            cutting out pictures from the illustrated catalogue<br>
            of the Army and Navy Stores, endowed the<br>
            picture of a refrigerator as his mother spoke with<br>
            heavenly bliss. It was fringed with joy. The<br>

            wheelbarrow, the lawn-mower, the sound of poplar<br>
            trees, leaves whitening before rain, rooks cawing,<br>
            brooms knocking, dresses rustling—all these<br>
            were so coloured and distinguished in his mind<br>
            that he had already his private code, his secret<br>
            language, though he appeared the image of stark<br>
            and uncompromising severity, with his high fore-<br>
            head and his fierce blue eyes, impeccably candid<br>
            and pure, frowning slightly at the sight of human<br>
            frailty, so that his mother, watching him guide<br>
            his scissors neatly round the refrigerator, imagined<br>
            him all red and ermine on the Bench or directing<br>
            a stern and momentous enterprise in some crisis<br>
            of public affairs.<br>

            "But," said his father, stopping in front of<br>
            the drawing-room window, "it won’t be fine."<br>
            Had there been an axe handy, a poker, or any<br>
            weapon that would have gashed a hole in his<br>
            father’s breast and killed him, there and then,<br>
            James would have seized it. Such were the<br>
            extremes of emotion that Mr. Ramsay excited<br>
            in his children’s breasts by his mere presence;<br>
            standing, as now, lean as a knife, narrow as the<br>
            blade of one, grinning sarcastically, not only with<br>
            the pleasure of disillusioning his son and casting<br>
            ridicule upon his wife, who was ten thousand<br>
            times better in every way than he was (James<br>
            thought), but also with some secret conceit at his<br>

        The Hours: Virginia Woolf’s Modern Echo
        <p>
          The film The Hours (2002) interweaves three parallel narratives to explore the enduring legacy of Virginia Woolf’s writing. One storyline portrays Woolf herself—struggling to compose Mrs. Dalloway—played by Nicole Kidman.
            The second follows Laura Brown (played by Julianne Moore), a 1950s housewife who reads Woolf’s novel and contemplates her own life choices. The third narrative centers on Clarissa Vaughan (played by Meryl Streep), a contemporary New Yorker planning a party for her friend Richard, a poet dying of suicide.
            The film's title refers to the concept of time and the hours that shape our lives, echoing Woolf's exploration of consciousness and the passage of time in her own work.
