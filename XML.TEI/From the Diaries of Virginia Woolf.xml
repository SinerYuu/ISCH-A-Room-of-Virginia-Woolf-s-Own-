        <head>The Diary (April, 1919)</head>
        <p>
          What sort of diary should I like mine to be? Something . . . so<lb/>
          elastic that it will embrace anything, solemn, slight or beautiful<lb/>
          that comes into my mind. I should like it to resemble some deep<lb/>
          old desk . . . in which one flings a mass of odds and ends<lb/>
          without looking them through. I should like to come back, after<lb/>
          a year or two, and find that the collection had sorted itself<lb/>
          and refined itself and coalesced, as such deposits so mysteriously<lb/>
          do, into a mould, transparent enough to reflect the light of our life.

        <head>Anxiety (October, 1920)</head>
        <p>
          Why is life so tragic; so like a little strip of pavement over an abyss.<lb/>
          I look down; I feel giddy; I wonder how I am ever to walk to the end.<lb/>
          But why do I feel this: Now that I say it I don't feel it. The fire<lb/>
          burns; we are going to hear The Beggar's Opera. Only it lies all<lb/>
          about me; I can't keep my eyes shut . . . And with it all how happy<lb/>
          I am – if it weren't for my feeling that it's a strip of pavement<lb/>
          over an abyss.

        <head>Fancy (February, 1927)</head>
        <p>
          Why not invent a new kind of play; as for instance:<lb/>
          Woman thinks:<lb/>
          He does.<lb/>
          Organ plays.<lb/>
          She writes.<lb/>
          They say:<lb/>
          She sings.<lb/>
          Night speaks.<lb/>
          They miss.

        <head>Hardy's Funeral (January, 1928)</head>
        <p>
          Yesterday we went to Hardy's funeral. What did I think of? Of Max<lb/>
          Beerbohm's letter . . . or a lecture . . . about women's writing.<lb/>
          At intervals some emotion broke in. But I doubt the capacity of<lb/>
          the human animal for being dignified in ceremony. One catches a<lb/>
          bishop's frown and twitch; sees his polished shiny nose; suspects<lb/>
          the rapt spectacled young priest, gazing at the cross he carries,<lb/>
          of being a humbug . . . next here is the coffin, an overgrown one;<lb/>
          like a stage coffin, covered with a white satin cloth; bearers<lb/>
          elderly gentlemen rather red and stiff, holding to the corners;<lb/>
          pigeons flying outside . . . processions to poets corner;<lb/>
          dramatic "In sure and certain hope of immortality" perhaps<lb/>
          melodramatic . . . Over all this broods for me some uneasy sense<lb/>
          of change and mortality and how partings are deaths; and then a<lb/>
          sense of my own fame . . . and a sense of the futility of it all.

        <head>Rome (May, 1935)</head>
        <p>
          Rome: tea. Tea in café. Ladies in bright coats and white hats.<lb/>
          Music. Look out and see people like movies . . . Ices.<lb/>
          Old man who haunts the Greco . . . Fierce large jowled old<lb/>

          poor black wispy women. The effect of dowdiness produced<lb/>
          by wispy hair. Sunday café . . . Very cold. The prime Minister's<lb/>
          letter offering to recommend me for the Companion of Honour. No.

        <head>War (June, 1940)</head>
        <p>
          This, I thought yesterday, may be my last walk . . . the war –<lb/>
          our waiting while the knives sharpen for the operation – has<lb/>
          taken away the outer wall of security. No echo comes back. I<lb/>
          have no surroundings . . . Those familiar circumlocutions –<lb/>
          those standards – which have for so many years given back an<lb/>
          echo and so thickened my identity are all wide and wild as<lb/>
          the desert now. I mean, there is no "autumn," no winter.<lb/>
          We pour to the edge of a precipice . . . and then? I can't<lb/>
          conceive that there will be a 27th June 1941.

        <head>Parents (December, 1940)</head>
        <p>
          How beautiful they were, those old people – I mean father and<lb/>
          mother – how simple, how clear, how untroubled. I have been<lb/>
          dipping into old letters and father's memoirs. He loved her:<lb/>
          oh and was so candid and reasonable and transparent . . .<lb/>
          How serene and gay even, their life reads to me: no mud;<lb/>
          no whirlpools. And so human – with the children and the<lb/>
          little hum and song of the nursery. But if I read as a<lb/>
          contemporary I shall lose my child's vision and so must<lb/>
          stop. Nothing turbulent; nothing involved; no introspection.

        <head>Last Entry (March, 1941)</head>
        <p>
          No: I intend no introspection. I mark Henry James' sentence:<lb/>
          Observe perpetually. Observe the oncome of age. Observe greed.<lb/>
          Observe my own despondency. By that means it becomes<lb/>
          serviceable. Or so I hope. I insist upon spending this<lb/>
          time to the best advantage. I will go down with my colours<lb/>
          flying . . . Occupation is essential. And now with some pleasure<lb/>
          I find that it's seven; and must cook dinner. Haddock and<lb/>
          sausage meat. I think it is true that one gains a certain<lb/>
          hold on sausage and haddock by writing them down.
