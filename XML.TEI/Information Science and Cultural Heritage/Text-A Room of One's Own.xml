        <p>
            But, you may say, we asked you to speak about<lb/>
            women and fiction—what has that got to do with<lb/>
            a room of one’s own? I will try to explain. When you<lb/>
            asked me to speak about women and fiction I sat<lb/>
            down on the banks of a river and began to Wonder<lb/>
            what the words meant. They might mean simply a<lb/>
            few remarks about Fanny Burney; a few more about<lb/>
            Jane Austen; a tribute to the Brontes and a sketch<lb/>
            of Haworth Parsonage under snow; some witticisms<lb/>
            if possible about Miss Mitford; a respectful allusion<lb/>
            to George Eliot; a reference to Mrs. Gaskell and<lb/>
            one would have done. But at second sight the words<lb/>
            seemed not so simple. The title women and fiction<lb/>
            might mean, and you may have meant it to mean,<lb/>
            women and what they are like; or it might mean<lb/>
            women and the fiction that they write; or it might<lb/>

            This essay is based upon two papers read to the Arts<lb/>
            Society at Newnham and the Odtaa at Girton in October<lb/>
            1928. The papers were too long to be read in full, and<lb/>
            have since been altered and expanded.<lb/>
            <pb n="5"/>
        </note>
        <p>
            mean women and the fiction that is written about<lb/> 
            them; or it might mean that somehow all three are<lb/>
            inextricably mixed together and you want me to<lb/> 
            consider them in that light. But when I began to<lb/> 
            consider the subject in this last way, which seemed the<lb/> 
            most interesting, I soon saw that it had one fatal<lb/> 
            drawback. I should never be able to come to a<lb/> 
            conclusion. I should never be able to fulfil what is,<lb/> 
            I understand, the first duty of a lecturer—to hand<lb/> 
            you after an hour’s discourse a nugget of pure<lb/>
            truth to wrap up between the pages of your note¬<lb/>
            books and keep on the mantelpiece for ever. All I<lb/>
            could do was to offer you an opinion upon one<lb/>
            minor point—a woman must have money and a<lb/>
            room of her own if she is to write fiction; and that,<lb/>
            as you will see, leaves the great problem of the true<lb/>
            nature of woman and the true nature of fiction<lb/>
            unsolved. I have shirked the duty of coming to a<lb/>
            conclusion upon these two questions—women and<lb/>
            fiction remain, so far as I am concerned, unsolved<lb/>
            problems. But in order to make some amends I<lb/>
            am going to do what I can to show you how I<lb/>
            arrived at this opinion about the room and the<lb/> 
            money. I am going to develop in your presence as<lb/> 
            fully and freely as I can the train of thought which<lb/> 
            led me to think this. Perhaps if I lay bare the ideas,<lb/>
