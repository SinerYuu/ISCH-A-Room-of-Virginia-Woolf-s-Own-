          The film <title ref="#the_hours">The Hours</title> (2002) interweaves three parallel narratives to explore the enduring legacy of <persName xml:id="Woolf">Virginia Woolf</persName>’s writing. One storyline portrays Woolf herself—struggling to compose <title xml:id="Mrs_Dalloway">Mrs. Dalloway</title>—played by Nicole Kidman.
            The second follows Laura Brown (played by Julianne Moore), a 1950s housewife who reads <persName ref="#Woolf">Woolf</persName>’s novel and contemplates her own life choices. The third narrative centers on Clarissa Vaughan (played by Meryl Streep), a contemporary New Yorker planning a party for her friend Richard, a poet dying of suicide.
            The film's title refers to the concept of time and the hours that shape our lives, echoing <persName ref="#Woolf">Woolf</persName>'s exploration of consciousness and the passage of time in her own work.
