        <p>
          MANY friends have helped me in writing this book.<lb/> 
          Some are dead and so illustrious that I scarcely<lb/> 
          dare name them, yet no one can read or write without being<lb/> 
          perpetually in the debt of Defoe, Sir Thomas Browne,<lb/> 
          Sterne, Sir Walter Scott, Lord Macaulay, Emily Bronté,<lb/> 
          De Quincey, and Walter Pater,—to name the first that come<lb/> 
          to mind. Others are alive, and though perhaps as illustrious<lb/> 
          in their own way, are less formidable for that very reason.<lb/> 
          I am specially indebted to Mr. C. P. Sanger, without whose<lb/> 
          knowledge of the law of real property this book could never<lb/> 
          have been written. Mr. Sydney-Turner’s wide and peculiar<lb/> 
          erudition has saved me, I hope, some lamentable blunders.<lb/>
          I have had the advantage—how great I alone can estimate<lb/>
          —of Mr. Arthur Waley’s knowledge of Chinese. Madame<lb/>
          Lopokova (Mrs. F. M. Keynes) has been at hand to correct<lb/>
          my Russian. To the unrivalled sympathy and imagination<lb/>
          of Mr. Roger Fry I owe whatever understanding of the art<lb/>
          of painting I may possess. I have, I hope, profited in an-<lb/>
          other department by the singularly penetrating, if severe,<lb/>
          criticism of my nephew Mr. Fulian Bell. Miss M. K.<lb/> 
          Snowdon’ s indefatigable researches in the archives of Har-<lb/> 
          rogate and Cheltenham were none the less arduous for being<lb/> 
          vain. Other friends have helped me in ways too various to <lb/>
          <pb n="7"/>
          specify. I must content myself with naming Mr. Angus<lb/> 
          Davidson; Mrs. Cartwright; Miss fanet Case; Lord Ber-<lb/> 
          ners (whose knowledge of Elizabethan music has proved<lb/> 
          invaluable); Mr. Francis Birrell; my brother, Dr. Adrian<lb/> 
          Stephen; Mr. F. L. Lucas; Mr. and Mrs. Desmond Mac-<lb/> 
          carthy; that most inspiriting of critics, my brother-in-law,<lb/> 
          Mr. Clive Bell; Mr. G. H. Rylands; Lady Colefax; Miss<lb/> 
          Nellie Boxall; Mr. F. M. Keynes; Miss Violet Dickinson;<lb/> 
          the Hon. Edward Sackville West; Mr. and Mrs. St. John<lb/> 
          Hutchinson; Mr. Duncan Grant; Mr. and Mrs. Stephen<lb/> 
          Tomlin; Mr. and Lady Ottoline Morrell; my mother-in-<lb/> 
          law, Mrs. Sidney Woolf; Mr. Osbert Sitwell; Madame<lb/> 
          Facques Raverat; Colonel Cory Bell; Miss Valerie Taylor;<lb/> 
          Mr. J. T. Sheppard; Mr. and Mrs. T. S. Eliot; Miss<lb/> 
          Ethel Sands; Miss Nan Hudson; my nephew, Mr. Quentin<lb/> 
          Bell (an old and valued collaborator in fiction); Mr. Ray-<lb/> 
          mond Mortimer; Miss Emphie Case; Lady Gerald Welles-<lb/> 
          ley; Mr. Lytton Strachey; the Viscountess Cecil; Miss Hope<lb/> 
          Mirrlees; Mr. E. M. Forster; the Hon. Harold Nicolson;<lb/> 
          my sister, Vanessa Bell—but the list threatens to grow too<lb/> 
          long and is already far too distinguished. For while it rouses<lb/> 
          in me memories of the pleasantest kind it will inevitably<lb/> 
          wake expectations in the reader which the book itself can<lb/> 
          only disappoint. Therefore I will conclude by thanking the<lb/> 
          officials of the British Museum and Record Office for their<lb/> 
          wonted courtesy; my niece Miss Angelica Bell, for a service<lb/>
